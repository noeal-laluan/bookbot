# Boot.Dev Bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

It uses Python to:
- Accept input file location of a book (in .txt format)
- Processes the entire text of the book to report the:
    - Word count
    - No. of instances of a single character

It currently only contains three functions in stats.py.
